    <h2 class="text-center">My Favorite Brands</h2>
    <p>The first brand that I would consider to be influential in the production of my own website would be a brand named “Drunk Elephant” . It’s a skincare brand that utilizes bold colors and cool transitions from one topic to the other on their site. Their layout is easy to navigate and captivating at the same time. Their design makes me want to click around to see what new transition will pop up next. I also really enjoy the bright colors that are on full display. With that said, I know from personally seeing the brand in stores that it draws a younger crowd due to its equally colorful packaging and “quirky” look. While I recognize that my goal isn’t to create something that looks inherently juvenile, I’m still hoping to incorporate colors in a way that looks unique to the average audience (not just 14 year old girls). &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Normally, I tend to stick to more muted colors like earth tones and blush pinks to create a calming effect. While I thought about doing that, especially for this assignment because I know basic color schemes tend to be more pleasing to the eye; but because of that, my projects end up looking similar to one another. I usually go for color schemes that run in the same family. With that said, I also think that if it’s done tastefully, the final product can look colorful without looking tacky. So for this site, I wanted to choose a more striking color choice and Drunk Elephant as a brand is the perfect thing to emulate. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>As for fonts, the brand I chose to take inspiration from is Apple. Color wise Apple is a complete 180 from the Drunk Elephant appearance using mainly whites and blacks as the primary colors on the website. But when it comes to fonts, Apple uses “softer” fonts that would be a nice blend with the bright color scheme that I’m going for. Their headings are a different font than the main words you see on the website which is a common design technique. It’s not often that you see a website designed with the same fonts throughout the whole thing, and if you do, I’m sure it’s a less interesting display. Along with their font colors, I also like that their transitions are only showcased when advertising a new product like that latest iPhone. Overall, I think that the Apple layout gave me good ideas as to how to show the most “important” thing on my website, while also giving me great inspiration for fonts.</p>
