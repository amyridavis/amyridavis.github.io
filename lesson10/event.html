    <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: The year was 2018 and a great tragedy struck the nation. Yet another high 
school had fallen victim to another mass shooting. At the time, I was a junior in high school and 
felt the effects as if it had happened close to home. The catastrophe that occurred that February
day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had sparked nationwide protests, school 
walkouts, and serious talks on gun reform.</p>
    <p><strong>Life before the walkout</strong> - Triad High School, in which I'm an alumni, resides many miles from 
Parkland, Florida and yet we as students still felt that we had an obligation to show our solidarity
with them. So me, along with 7 other students spoke with the principal about doing a walkout. 
Before the actual walkout had taken place, each of the people involved had work to do to 
prepare. I was in charge of creating a minute to minute and a half long speech outlining the 
reason for the walkout and also addressing the tragedy that took place. Some students made t-
shirts. Others made posters to hang around the school, and lastly, the principal gave us the 
stamp of approval to proceed with it. </p>
    <p><strong>During the walkout</strong> - I had made it known that the students should only participate in the 
walkout if they were willing to take a 17 minute moment of silence around our flagpole, and read
the names of the victims of which their lives were lost. As the speaker, I tried to make it very 
clear that the intention was not to just get out of a class period, but to draw attention to the fact 
that this wasn’t the first school shooting that had happened while we were in school, and it 
definitely wouldn’t be the last. Watching the news and understanding that there were young 
people our age that had gone through something unthinkable, drove the urge to want to help in 
any way we could. At the time, I noticed there were students across the United States protesting
at their town’s courthouse with the intention of getting lawmakers attention. While that would’ve 
made a statement, logistically it wouldn’t have worked out for me and where my high school was
located. </p>
    <p>Although the walkout was a show of solidarity with the Parkland community, things still felt 
undone. While gun reform was talked about amongst lawmakers due to the civil unrest and pure
grief that radiated through the country, there has yet to be a law that was passed in regards to 
that day. While I hated getting my first taste of activism through such a harrowing time, I’m 
forever grateful to have had the opportunity to create a speech that encompassed all the 
information that our student body needed to know in order to make their own informed decisions
moving forward. </p>
